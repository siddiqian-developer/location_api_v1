Please implement geospatial query in mongodb to return a descending sorted list of documents based on user coordinates. This method should also implement pagination, use mongodb $limit method.

I recommend using mongoDB Compass application for working with the database, it makes writing document queries easier.

Feel free to simplify the location object in the database if you need to, especially if there is a performance gain.

If you have any questions please contact me anytime! Thank you!
